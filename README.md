### Temporarily Up again!

After a week of 404-ing we are back (April 26 2013 - May 2nd 2013)! 

dotCloud.com has moved to a different business model and our app was no longer supported (but there was a little miscommunication about this). We apologize for the downtime, but we have found temporary shelter thanks to the fine folks at [Boston University's BUILDS hackerspace](http://builds.cc/).

This is a repository for  [Zippopotamus](http://www.zippopotam.us) the global postal code API

Zippopotamus is hosted by [dotCloud](http://dotCloud.com). This repo is used to build and maintain the site.

If you want to contribute to the improving the site, back-end, front-end etc. Just fork away and submit pull requests. 

### Sample Implementations 

Checkout the `static/` folder to see some of the sample implementations of Zippopotamus for inspiration and examples for how to implement Zippopotamus API for use in your website etc.

If you want to share an implementation, we would love to post example cases of Zippopotamus on our homepage.

### Response Format

On May 1st Zippopotamus changed their JSON response format to work better with international postal codes.  Now we support a one-to-many format service. That is that one zip code may map to many regions, this is common in countries like Spain and France (but not in the US and Germany). 

## Postal Code Information

For information our postal codes and countries supported, you should check out the [zippopotamus crowd-sourcing project](https://github.com/crowell/zippopotamus).  Here you can download the entire database dump, or fork and add changes that we will incorporate into our DB.

## Technical Information

### What is Zippopotamus built on

At the moment the zippopotamus is built on Python, MongoDB and bottle.py framework.

### Local Testing?

The site is configured to run on dotCloud, if you want to test out the web interfaceyou can change the wsgi.py file to include the last commented line, which is used to run the site on your local host.
